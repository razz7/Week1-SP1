# Week1 SP1

## Tuesday
 I solved all the exercises except for the Junit test.
The solution for the exercises "EX1 1-7" can be found in the folder 01_tuesday in the subprojectfolder called point. 
The second part can be found in the subprojectfolder called Week1Ex2. I dind't complete the jUnit test part. 
But i did complete all the facade methods. 
The start guide is in the subprojectfolder PlainJPA.
The soulutions for these exercises has covered:
- ORM framework
- The use of JPA and the way to presist entities in a database 
- It also has given us an understanding in how to use the Persistence.xml file to set up our java to diffrenct databases. 

## Wednsday 

I sloved all but the last endpoint assgianment. 
The solution can be found in the folder 03_wednsday Where there is a project called rest1.
This soloutions covers: 
- How a Restfull webservice works with java
- How to make new endpoints 
- How to use pathParmas to get a specific respose from our api 
- How we can return the data from java to the client i json format. 


## Thursday 

# Excercise0
i dindt have time to finish the tester assginemnt in the jpql-demo-for-day4. I forgot about them.

# Excercise1

I solved some of the excercises. 
- Exercise 1 I solved 1-5
- Exercise 2 I solved 1-3
- Excercise 3 i solved 1 and 3. 

The second Excercise in Excercise 3 I made the endpoints: 
- /api/employee/all
- /api/employee/{id}

The last two points wont work for me. 

All of this above can be found the the 03_thursday folder, in the project folder week1-simple-jpa-rest

i dindt have time to finish the tester assginemnt in the jpql-demo-for-day4.

# Excercise3

I have deployed the site on http://165.232.73.154:8081/jpa_rest_startup-1.0/ 
but the endpoints dont work because there is no data in the DB. 
For some reason i cant talk to the DB. 

- The part i did shows how we can get data from a database to a client with a simple GET request. 
- It also shows how to use the DTO classes to hide some of data we get from the databas, in this case its "salary".
- I have designet some JPQL QUeries but im still not 100 sure how they work and how to use the to search for names etc.
